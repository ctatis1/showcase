# What is a colour model?

Computers understand binary language i.e. 0s and 1s. Colours are also 0s and 1s inside a computer. But while designing anything digital you do not tell the computer that hey, I want to use 01011101 colour. Obviously, we do not use the binary code. Here we use a colour model to specify a colour in terms of some parameters which in turn will send the 0’s and 1’s to the display and tell it what colour has to be shown for each desired pixel.

Putting it simply, a colour model is a system to represent a colour.

# HSB Model

So there is this other model out there which deals with the Hue (H), Saturation (S) and Brightness (B).

In this model, a colour can be represented by the hue it carries, how much saturated it is and the brightness it has. The H(ue) parameter takes value from 0 to 360, whereas the S(aturation) and B(rightness) parameters take value from 0 to 100. This model is also alternatively known as HSV where V stands for Value and ranges from 0 to 100.

If we look at the combinations here:
* At the centre of the base — Saturation is 0 while the Brightness is 100 which gives us the colour — White irrespective of the hue.
* On the opposite side — at the tip of the cone, Saturation is 0 and the Brightness is 0 too which gives us the colour — Black irrespective of the Hue.
