**Exercise 5**  
Exercise
Implement an image / video processing app supporting different masks, including other kernel sizes different than 3x3, and:
* A region-of-interest base tool to selectively apply a given mask.Hint: circular regions around the mouse pointer are handy and quite simple to implement by means of glsl distance.
* A magnifier tool. Requires a bit of research. For instance, look for it in shadertoy.
* Integrate luma and other coloring brightness tools.
What other shader tools would you implement?
