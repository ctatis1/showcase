# Exercise Moiré Patterns and Kinegrams 

{{< hint info >}}
**Exercise 3**  
Implement a kinegram and some moiré patterns which are close related visual phenomena to masking.
{{< /hint >}}

# Introduction
## Moiré Pattern

"‘ Moiré ’ is a French word meaning a silk fabric that has been subjected to heat and pressure rollers after weaving to give it a rippled appearance.

The “Moiré Pattern” is an interference pattern produced by placing the similar templates , slightly offset by spacing or angle." 

## Kinegram

"The Kinegrams artfully combine the visual effects of moiré patterns with the zoetrope animation technique."

# Solution
In order to create a kinegram with a Moiré pattern we created 5 cylinders using a lot of ellipses. Then we implement the Moiré pattern which runs across the canvas from top to bottom using the function mouseY. This movement creates the desired effect on the cylinders. The original code was provided by https://naziafakhruddin.medium.com/the-mysterious-moiré-pattern-49d797897355 and we did some changes in order to understand it works.

# Code

function setup() {
  createCanvas(720, 560);
}

function draw() {
  background(220)
  for (let j = 0; j <1000; j+=7){
    
    stroke(0)
    strokeWeight(3)
    line( 0, j+mouseY,width, j+ mouseY)
    stroke('cyan')
    strokeWeight(3)
    noFill()
    ellipse(j, 100, 100, 100)
    stroke('blue')
    strokeWeight(3)
    noFill()
    ellipse(j, 200, 100, 100)
    stroke('magenta')
    strokeWeight(3)
    noFill()
    ellipse(j, 300, 100, 100)
    stroke('yellow')
    strokeWeight(3)
    noFill()
    ellipse(j, 400, 100, 100)
    stroke('green')
    strokeWeight(3)
    noFill()
    ellipse(j, 500, 100, 100)

# Conclusions
Moiré patterns are useful in different fields of knowledge. The exercise presented before is just a brief example of how them could be applied. 
The combination of Kinegrams and Moiré patterns is important in arts and animation and can generate new interesting effects that can be leverage in photography, videogames, movies, image processing and printing.
